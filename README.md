  Using dataset flights from library nycflights13 in R, we can generate:

  - __Plot 1__ A barplot where the bars show the number of flights from 'EWR' to 'LAX' for each of the carriers.

  - __Plot 2__ A density plot for each of the underlying empirical distributions corresponding to a different carrier.

  - __Plot 3__ A boxplot for the speed by month for all flights from 'EWR' to 'LAX'.

  - __Plot 4__ Multiple scatterplots to visually explore how delay at departure affects delay at arrival by carriers ('EWR' to 'LAX' only).
